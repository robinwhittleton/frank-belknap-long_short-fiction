      The home of Poe! It is like a fairy dwelling, a gnomic palace built of the
      aether of dreams. It is tiny and delicate and lovely, and replete with
      memories of sere leaves in November and of lilies in April. It is a castle
      of vanished hopes, of dimly-remembered dreams, of sad memories older than
      the deluge. The dead years circle slowly and solemnly around its low white
      walls, and clothe it in a mystic veil of unseen tears. And many marvellous
      stories could this quaint little old house tell, many weird and cryptic
      stories of him of the Raven hair, and high, pallid brow, and sad, sweet
      face, and melancholy mien; and of the beloved Virginia, that sweet child
      of a thousand magic visions, child of the lonesome, pale-gray latter
      years, child of the soft and happy South. And how the dreamer of the
      spheres must have loved this strange little house. Every night the hollow
      boards of its porch must have echoed to his footfall, and every morn the
      great rising sun must have sent its rays through the little window, and
      bathed the lovely tresses of the dream-child in mystical yellow. And
      perhaps there was laughter within the walls of that houseâ€”laughter
      and merriment and singing. But we know that the Evil One came at last, the
      grim humourless spectre who loves not beauty, and is not of this world.
      And we know that the house of youth and of love became a house of death,
      and that memories bitter as the tears of a beautiful woman assailed the
      dreamer within. And at last he himself left that house of mourning and
      sought solace among the stars. But the house remains a vision out of a
      magical book; a thing seen darkly as in a looking-glass; but lovely beyond
      the dreams of mortals, and ineffably sad.
